ECB:
For both encryption and decryption, only one block is effected by a 1-bit error and that's the block with the error since there is no chaining
in ECB mode.

Example:
Encryption:
We used "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout." as a plaintext and used a key
of "1100001 0110101 1011010 0100011 0001001" the result of which was:
10110000101011001111001011100010111001010101110011001110010111010001001011100101100101011100101111101011111111111111001100011000011101000100110111100010001010110111111110011011101101101100110001100011101100110111011111111000101011001111011001101111110101000011010100000111110101010011101111100100001000000111000011110011000101000001011111001110000101101110111000011010110110111000101110101111111101111101100111111011011111111011101001001111001011110100110110010101110110010111010111110111011111111001100100001100111111100010110111010011000001011011101110000101000110010010000110100110111110101001101111111000110101111011111110110100111010100001101010001011110010101011110111000011010100101111000001010011100101000110101111101110111010011011000001000100011110011111111101010110101010110011110010111000101111111111000000110101111101111001011011011001001011000010011001101101001

Decryption:
Changing one bit in the ciphertext (the third bit) resulted in the decrypted text being:
"It ir a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout."
As you can see, the only block that was affected was the block that the error was in.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CBC:
For encryption, the number of blocks effected by a 1-bit error in CBC depends on which block the error occurs in.  An error would
effect the block containing the error and all subsequent blocks.
For decryption however, two blocks are effected by a 1-bit error in CBC, the block with the error, and the following block.

Example:
Encryption:
We used "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout." as a plaintext and used a key

with an IV of: 10110010100011001010111101100101110

Decryption:
Changing one bit in the ciphertext (the third bit) resulted in the decrypted text being:
"It ir0a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. "
As you can see, the blocks that were affected were the first and second blocks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CFB:
For encryption, the number of blocks effected by a 1-bit error in CFB depends on which block the error occurs in.  An error would
effect the block containing the error and all subsequent blocks.
For decryption however, two blocks are effected by a 1-bit error in CFB, the block with the error, and the following block.

ECB:
For both encryption and decryption, only one block is effected by a 1-bit error and that's the block with the error since there is no chaining
in ECB mode.

CBC:
For encryption, the number of blocks effected by a 1-bit error in CBC depends on which block the error occurs in.  An error would
effect the block containing the error and all subsequent blocks.
For decryption however, two blocks are effected by a 1-bit error in CBC, the block with the error, and the following block.

CFB:
For both encryption and decryption, the number of blocks effected by a 1-bit error in CFB depends on which block the error occurs in.  An error would effect
the block containing the error and all subsequent blocks.

OFB:
For both encryption and decryption, only one block is effected by a 1-bit error in OFB, the block in which the error occurs.

CTR:
For both encryption and decryption, only one block is effected by a 1-bit error in CTR, the block in which the error occurs.
